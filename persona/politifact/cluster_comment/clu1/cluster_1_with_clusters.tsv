11. Political power is not about winning the debate, it's deciding what the debate is about. Collins is a moderate because Bill Clinton's generation redefined Democratic politics to a West Wing-ish vision of being nice, soft-spoken, 'authentic,' and friendly with the other side.	2030711	politifact9512	8

At least Chispa and League of Conservation Voters are actual social welfare organizations with agendas, a history and a track record -- not just front groups thrown together to mask the source of donations.	24757092	politifact9512	8
"So are the oil executives that donated to him stupid then? Or maybe do they know something that we don't know?

Given the opportunity to vote for candidates that are opposed entirely by the oil industry, why would we choose Beto?"	866711222988701698	politifact9512	4
They're not stupid, they're just placing bets and hoping for a payoff down the road. These are not significant sums of money to them.	774143246289166340	politifact9512	4
I'm not even saying you should choose Beto. I'm saying that if corporate America was looking to Beto to be their shill for anti-enviro votes, in return for the checks some execs gave him, they failed.  He's largely been very good on enviro votes.	776159788182999040	politifact9512	8
To be fair though it's not like he's really ever been given the opportunity to support a truly bold climate change plan, the kind that is necessary. We don't know where his line is drawn. But some oil execs think they do, and they probably have better info that you or I.	866711222988701698	politifact9512	8
That's true, and I reckon if he does run, you'll quickly find out. And you'll likely still see Bernie being the gold standard of bold plans.  And that's a reason to support him in a primary. But, it also doesn't mean Beto's some corporate empty suit, either.	776159788182999040	politifact9512	8
They don't have any super-secret inside knowledge; they're just hoping. As has been pointed out, Beto has a very good voting record on the environment. I put more importance on that than on the donations.	774143246289166340	politifact9512	8
He literally recently voted to allow off shore drilling, my dude.	712552463174393856	politifact9512	14
