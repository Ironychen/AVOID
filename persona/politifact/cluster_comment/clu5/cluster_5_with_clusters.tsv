You're wrong again. It's the Codified Rules of a government office whose creation and management are defined by... you guess it... FEDERAL LAW... passed by Congress - the Federal Register Act of 1935. He could change them, but only through an EO. the CFR carries the weight of LAW	50461906	politifact14920	2
Nope. the USC (United States Code) are laws passed by Congress. CFRs are regulations written by the agencies to carry out those laws. All he has to do is write a EO and the Special Counsel would be no more. Not true with laws passed by Congress.	3617368214	politifact14920	3
how about you cite a precedent, lawyer, judge, or legal scholar to back up your assertions? it's not a matter of lies/spin, it's a matter of reality. there is no penalty ascribed to not following that law, the matter is essentially resolved from a governmental/legal standpoint.	217923746	politifact14920	2
they have been penalized by the government within the law (as in no penalty). further, it is protected under the first amendment. the matter is a private one ultimately, the nfl can penalize them as they see fit.	217923746	politifact14920	2
the president should not be weighing in on this, as it skirts violating the first amendment since he is a member of the government. let the nfl deal with it.	217923746	politifact14920	2
It's law & they could be arrested charged & convicted but no jail time or fine would be leveled except for court costs unless a judge stepped up & sentenced due to special circumstances like using their platform to incite. A law doesn't need a precedent for it to be a law.	2833322863	politifact14920	2
okay, so explain why they haven't been penalized yet? it's happened in multiple states, multiple times. why has no law enforcement enforced this law?	217923746	politifact14920	0
