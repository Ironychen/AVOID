By establishing birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment repudiated the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which had declared that African Americans--whether free or enslaved--could not be U.S. citizens. #ULSG	377608346	politifact14474	3
"Section 1 also prevents the states from passing legislation that violated the ""privileges and immunities"" citizens, requires due process of the law for all citizens, & guarantees equal protection of the laws. #ULSG"	377608346	politifact14474	3
Section 2 concerns the apportionment of representation in Congress. The 14th Amendment did not guarantee suffrage rights, & in fact allowed states to prevent blacks & other males from voting. However, if they did so, their representation would decreased accordingly. #ULSG	377608346	politifact14474	3
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, & other women's rights activists actually criticized the 14th Amendment because it inserted the word 'male' into the Constitution for the first time. #ULSG	377608346	politifact14474	3
"Section 2 also refers to ""Indians not taxed."" Congress considered the various Indian tribes as separate sovereign entities and as such, Native American Indians with tribal affiliations remained non-citizens (This would not change until 1924). #ULSG"	377608346	politifact14474	3
Section 3 puts political disabilities on certain former Confederates who had previously taken an oath to support the U.S. Constitution & prevents them from holding office. These disabilities were removed after the 1872 Amnesty Act was passed & signed by President Grant. #ULSG	377608346	politifact14474	3
Section 4 prevents the federal govt. or states from assuming debts incurred by the Confederacy during the war. That includes former slave property, which some former Confederates attempted to be reimbursed for after the Civil War. #ULSG	377608346	politifact14474	3
"Section 5 is pretty self-explanatory, but ultimately grants wide leverage to Congress to enforce the 14th Amendment with future ""appropriate legislation."" #ULSG"	377608346	politifact14474	3
And so with this thread we think about the meaning of the 14th Amendment & the ways its transformed American's legal & political culture since 1868. Happy 14th Amendment day! #ULSG	377608346	politifact14474	3

There may be legal limitations. In certain one-party states (DC is one-party), you are violating wiretapping laws if you *broadcast* an audio recording without express permission	17066729	politifact1067	3
"But that only applies to recording, which doesn't appear to be an issue here. The issue is the NYT's usage of the tape. So if the Times wanted to post the full audio with the story, would that be ok based on the ""ground rules?"""	1365714145	politifact1067	3
Sounds like the reporter was not 100% clear with Miller about what the full usage would be.  I agree it should be implied if you're recorded and on-record, but in many states you have to specifically get permission to BROADCAST a recording	17066729	politifact1067	3
If you tell a source the interview is going to be used for selective quoting and background info for a story, it strikes me as unethical to then post the full audio. As a frequent interviewee, I'd be unhappy if it was done to me.	403908693	politifact1067	3
"If that made some sort of promise, then I agree. But an interview with a public official like a top adviser to the POTUS is different. To me, a public official assuming audio would be used ""for selective quoting"" would require an express promise."	1365714145	politifact1067	3

But again, my overall point isn't that NET is good. Just that the #1 team having a poor schedule isn't *by itself* evidence it's bad. Virginia is near the top in most predictive ratings"	127678002	politifact12104	3
They beat #6 on neutral court, destroyed the weaker teams they've faced. It's what you'd expect a #1 team to do. Do I think they are the best? No. Probably Duke, Gonzaga, or Michigan. But I think it's OK for a system that doesn't use preseason ratings to have Virginia at the top.	127678002	politifact12104	3
I am not arguing Virginia should be #1. Just that whether they played a strong or weak schedule overall wouldn't affect their rating, in an ideal world where NET was perfectly designed to accurately predict what the NCAA says it is trying to predict (results of late season games)	127678002	politifact12104	3
Also, Virginia's schedule ranks so poorly on KenPom in part because they of several games against truly terrible teams. If they replace those with games against teams ranked 100 spots higher, their SOS rank improves dramatically, but the difficulty for an elite team barely budges	127678002	politifact12104	3
The point being, dominating against #320 or against #150 has a huge effect in SOS, but shouldn't have a huge effect on a predictive rating.	127678002	politifact12104	3

Gomez and Matip being fit again allow for rotation at the back, which will be minimal anyway should VVD and Lovren stay fit.

Not a professional author, but I guess, after agent's commission it's around $60K/book, and then down to $51K if you're in the 15% tax bracket. You would get that in at least a couple different installments, based on the publisher's schedule, and not yours.	824368272254459904	politifact12104	3

necessarily bad,rather it's just that you get so attached to the characters you just wish you grew to know them even more. but octopath is not that kind of game. it's not a long, epic compendium of stories, rather, they almost feel like entries come to life from one's personal	921205838190120961	politifact12104	3
journal. And I haven't played a game yet until now that gave me that impression. Octopath never once tries to be more than what it is - a collection of personal stories. Some are simple.

I think rich, 'stable' countries must include nuclear as a significant % of their energy mix.	555295572	politifact12104	3
However, globally, nuclear is not the solution for the vast majority of countries. Any not in G20 pretty much would struggle to afford the costs.	555295572	politifact12104	3
1) Russia, China and Korea provide finance for their projects in the developing world. 2) this isn't and won't be a problem for a long time if at all. 3) you don't need nuclear power for nuclear weapons, in fact the evidence is the opposite, get power, don't get weapons	15125079	politifact12104	3

I hope and expect that Small Modular Reactors will become available and will significantly reduce the unit cost of nuclear plants. Speaking of cost, developing  countries have Boeing jets.

You're right that nuclear waste is a problem. Every engineering process has to deal with problematic waste products. However, the waste is very small, safely stored at interim facilities, and potentially very useful as it's full of fissile plutonium and other fissionable nuclides	956748927394459649	politifact12104	3
Mostly due to Uranium's absolutely mind-boggling energy density, nuclear requires a MUCH smaller mass of material per unit of electricity than any other energy source. As a result, it produces much less waste, which greatly simplifies the disposal of that waste	956748927394459649	politifact12104	3
Currently, nuclear waste is stored in large concrete dry casks to contain the radiation that the waste produces. This waste is solid and stored on-site at the plants that produced it.

The only thing that men should be 'educated' on is knowing to stay away from all girls at parties, just in case. By your reasoning, if both parties are drunk then neither can consent and both have been assaulted? Or can only the woman cry 'rape' if she regrets it?	24690094	politifact12104	3
Wait. If a girl is drunk and has sex, she never consented? But if both the guy and the girl are drunk, both consented?	714645916528078848	politifact12104	3

There's a line to tread perhaps. Also some regret accusations could come from someone who wasn't even that inebriated or at all, but just changed their mind and accuses. Also it's important to note genders can differentiate on accuser to accused	86818530	politifact12104	3

Depends:  Some people class drunk as a few drinks and being mouthy.  That's not drunk, that's tipsy.  Drunk is paralytic, unable to walk straight, unaware of anything.  If you like some one and choose to take that person home, fully aware etc then it's not rape.	750607897109889024	politifact12104	3
As I said.. depends what people classify drunk..  I class drunk as paralytic.  Not someone just being mouthy and having a laugh.   I know people that classify drunk after 1 pint..  unless you want to call it extreme drunk but the point is there.	750607897109889024	politifact12104	3

I actually think Cotto's accomplishments are better than Mosley's even though Mosley fought the better opposition. Cotto becoming lineal middleweight champ beating a one legged Martinez sealed it for me	1119993054	politifact12104	3

Cotto, Hatton, Morales, Diaz, & Barrera are legit. DLH can go either way, Mosley was already at the end but was too stubborn. Margarito please, there's a reason he's the opponent they chose to fight for the vacant 8th title to make history. Clottey? He was inactive/lost to Cotto	1357087062	politifact12104	3
Again, the skeptic in me totally agrees with you here. But you just can't pin an opponent's shortcomings on a guy. Unless he fought them in lieu of fighting a more credible opponent, which Pacquiao rarely did, it's hard to always be fighting the perfect opponent in their prime.	267170391	politifact12104	3
What I'm saying is Pac is an ATG but those same names say instead of Pac it was SRL who fought them under the same circumstances, there wouldn't be a single decision win they'd all be by KO ESPECIALLY DLH(quit on the stool but didnt go down), Mosley, Margacheato, and Clottey.	1357087062	politifact12104	3
Pac has a great resume but in the lower weight divisions is his best work as a whole, moving up he's got some great wins and other with asterisks. A lot of it had to do with the fact Arum kept him fighting in house names.	1357087062	politifact12104	3

Maybe u don't remember 2016. Novak got to three of the four major finals won two of them and held the No. 1 for 95% of the season, he also held all 4 majors in June of the year. Murray won one major and the WTF. So id advise u to think about that before u tweet.	1111311091	politifact12104	3

Andy Reid has a long and consistent history of maximizing the production of his RBs both as a runner and receiver. So I'll take Hunt.	14852117	politifact12104	3
Fournette is the only RB here that is the focal point of the teams offense.  Every other RB on this list has multiple weapons, Fournette not so much	1343242490	politifact12104	3
I still like Mixon the most out of these 4...	791119576272478209	politifact12104	3
The bottom three are all in the same tier and very close. Mixon is a tier below. Im going Hunt because of his versatility and Cook coming off injury but all three are great picks	1468567448	politifact12104	3
Fournette - run first team w/ the draft capital and talent for long term insulation. I want all 4, but I'm still taking Fournette if I just get one	846534923968286720	politifact12104	3
"I would want Hunt. His rookie numbers even with the ""bad stretch"" were ridiculous. In rare company and honestly Ware doesn't scare me much. After that, give me Dalvin because of the strong offense he finds himself in. Followed by LF, and shocking no one-Mixon last."	2571434593	politifact12104	3
"Love all 4, to begin with...
Fournette: NO - but if PPC yes
Mixon: NO - Not enough trust just yet
Hunt: NO - But very close 2nd
Cook: YES - PPR, great offense, such a great talent"	3259171862	politifact12104	3
I lean Fournette or Cook. 4net was comped to (and rightfully so) to Bo Jackson. Immense talent coming out of college, produced in his rookie year, no competition. I think people soured on him  unnecessarily.	880810297866334208	politifact12104	3
Top two would be Hunt and LF for me. I think Hunt is the ceiling play whereas LF is the floor play. After that it'd be Cook and then Mixon.	280752188	politifact12104	3
I would be happy with Cook or Fournette, but i would ran them Cook, Fournette, Hunt, Mixon	1001534472448163840	politifact12104	3
Fournette has the highest floor of the bunch AND possibly the highest ceiling based on projected workload/likelihood to be the focal point of his offense. Injuries are a bit of a concern but aren't injuries a concern for all RBs?	215403832	politifact12104	3
If cook hadn't blown his knee, it would be him easy. Good offense, good game script chances, pass catching. LF has a better line but less reception upside. Hunt might split more work with Ware than people care to admit.	4222495623	politifact12104	3
You have to pick Hunt out of this group he already lead the league in rushing as a rookie and he also catches as good as anyone.	933411881989132288	politifact12104	3
I like Mixon but, going Fournette. Just acquired him in one league. Like the volume and Oline there even if the ankle is worrisome.	200536922	politifact12104	3
Fournette. Steven Jackson like focus of the offense. Good O-line. Hunt is the only one close.	246840901	politifact12104	3
Cook for sure.  He is in the best offense with the best QB.  Fournette is and injury concern, Hunt is with an untested QB and Mixon has a bad QB situation.	2254251095	politifact12104	3
How is Cook winning after an ACL tear and two good games ever?	1003974522041663491	politifact12104	3
Fournette for me #touches	20600195	politifact12104	3
I feel like Fournette is in a perfect long term situation. The Jags will continue to work on their offensive line, and I feel like he will lead the league in the near future	1233871772	politifact12104	3
This is really an interesting mix. I won't own Mixon for non-football reasons. I like Fournette but do have real concerns about his durability, and you could say the same for Cook. Hunt looked great last year but who knows. I went with Fournette, with much trepidation.	14715321	politifact12104	3
It's tough. I was having a hard time filtering through them	860368100	politifact12104	3

Hunt led the league in rushing...	1003974522041663491	politifact12104	3
Yes he did. From week 6 on he didnt have the same type of stats or touches you would expect out of a guy that led the league in rushing. Aside from weeks 14 and 15 that is. Maybe that's the coaches fault I'm not sure. He sure wasnt hands down better than fournette throughout	552319315	politifact12104	3

This is incorrect. As I understand it, it's projected that 1 in 4 will have an abortion if current abortion rates prevail. But abortion rates are trending down (not sure whether you consider that good or bad). I agree with being open about it, but be accurate too.	272152654	politifact12104	3
Access is being slowly extinguished....that is the point. If women can't afford to get to a clinic, they will resort to other means	261353132	politifact12104	3

Here's what I don't get. You say it's good rates are down. Is that an acknowledgement that abortion is undesirable? If it is, why? The article is arguing on the grounds of privacy. But pro lifers aren't arguing on those grounds. So why argue that? The argument revolves... 1/	18162261	politifact12104	3
I would think abortion rate down means using birth control methods is up.	143061007	politifact12104	3
Because what's driving the rate down is better access to birth control pills (and healthcare in general), and Plan B.  All of which are safer than abortion (which is still very safe). So the rate dropping is good from that perspective.	4546886249	politifact12104	3
... completely around whether abortion is murder. That is the sole basis of the pro life vs pro choice debate. If you can't answer that question, you'll have a hard time making any ground against pro life advocates. But that's a really sticky argument which is why it's avoided	18162261	politifact12104	3
1 in 4 is a considerable underestimate precisely because rates are trending down. 24%  is an estimate of lifetime likelihood of at least on abortion based on current age-specific rates. Those rates were rather higher 20+ years ago.	1692588589	politifact12104	3

Hes constantly been one of the most sacked QBs this entire season...and reasons are different from excuses..reasons come from common sense. So get some	946659725201907712	politifact12104	3
Seriously tho, his LT is a rook who is injured and has been decent overall, showing flashes. Still allows sacks/pressures. His RT is a backup, 3rd Rd rook who has struggled mightily. Lowest graded OT in the NFL a couple weeks ago. Tom Cable is OL coach. Need I say more?	3867434001	politifact12104	3
Cable should never have been hired, but next year we'll go OL with early picks b/c (1) Cable is our draft guru and (2) all resources must be put into preventing sacks. These are two sides of the same ridiculous coin.  Let Carr be sacked. See if he can play like the other QBs.	770293819506122752	politifact12104	3
Raiders only really need a RT and depth. Parker isn't an NFL OT. Carr has proven that with competent pass blocking (enough time to at least make reads on most plays), he can play at a high level. He didn't even get that vs KC (3 sacks), still played at an elite level.	3867434001	politifact12104	3
Carr has literally never had 4 all pros on his OL. He's had 3 pro bowlers, only 2 of which made All pro. That was when Raiders ran a power scheme. They switched it in the '16-'17 off-season to outside zone (which you dont do with the biggest OL in the NFL). Struggled ever since.	3867434001	politifact12104	3
sorry, 4 Pro Bowlers:  Gabe, Penn, Osemele, Hudson.  How many do you think the average team has?  The Raiders have the highest paid OL in the league.  Still:  not good enough for precious Derek.  He can only be good if he is never, ever pressured.  That's on everyone else.	770293819506122752	politifact12104	3
Gabe wasnt a pro bowler, he was an alternate. That's what happens when you have a top 5 run game and allow the least sacks (even if that was mostly the QB having a quick release). KO has regressed, BIG TIME. I wouldnt be surprised if hes cut in the off-season.	3867434001	politifact12104	3

stand up immediately, weirdly enough nothing like that happens on any of the other levels, either doesn't allow you to reload last checkpoint at all or just sends you back to the starting cutscene of the level	769517798	politifact12104	3
if the level was timed without loads it'd definitely be faster though since once you shoot the turrets and take down whoever's shield you can reload last checkpoint and it'll despawn the other one, but that load between doing that takes a decent number of seconds unfortunately	769517798	politifact12104	3
I'd love to be able to time without loads, but have no expertise in making the livesplit plugins or anything. It would be pretty neat to include in the run, plus I've always wondered if we had different load times but I've never timed them or anything	2344581876	politifact12104	3
