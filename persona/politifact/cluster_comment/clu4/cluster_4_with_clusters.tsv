Watched you interview with David Cicilline (D-RI) this morning. Thank you far pointing out how he was wrong in so many areas. GOOD JOB!!!	813170115432816640	politifact677	0
Very disappointing that Maria kept talking over the ceremony during the playing of the national anthem. Who is the General on stage with President Trump.	893413934	politifact677	12
Quit talking over the ceremony.	893413934	politifact677	3
Thank you for calling out talking points!	1754241	politifact677	9
Wow. Outstanding interview and questions. You had control and nowhere for him to get out of the questions. Great job Maria, great job.	843003168	politifact677	0
"Maria, you should have asked Cicciline to define ""middle class"". If he took the bait, he probably given you a income level that doesn't result in a material amount of taxes.  Apparently, the US has taken in a record amount of tax receipts this year."	17849013	politifact677	7
Maria you are great!!!	955432063364227072	politifact677	13

You watch these Dems. with their talking points and it is so terrible, Trump is the one trying to lover Drug Cost they only thing they did with Obamacare was to screw the middle class. They are in and EVERYTHING is going to be Trump when he is doing a great job...	15545407	politifact677	4

That intellectual beating she just gave cicilline was brutal. I kind of feel like I needed to pay to watch that. #assWhooping	32957685	politifact677	6
I watch your show. Why don't you ask the Dems to show their tax returns for the last 5 years? Ask how much they earn a year and how much are they worth? How many houses do they own and where are they located? Are they millionaires? The Dems are nothing but bullies. Push back!	1061653707966873601	politifact677	4

And your program is more important than honoring the veterans. You continue to do a political interview while the national anthem was playing in France honoring our country and the war dead. This was the height of disrespect.	736571584597483523	politifact677	7

You tried. Rep Cicillne is just delusional, at best.	27708217	politifact677	8
"Look at the beating sheep agreeing w/you. You, Maria, think you are doing ""hard-hitting journalism."" but it's 1/2-baked pablum. Your interrogation of Cicilline was a disgrace....you didn't hear a word he said & you lie, spin, tell 1/2 truths.  It is dangerous."	733445144733753345	politifact677	7

Maria, SS IS NOT ENTITLEMENTS	730239133034090497	politifact677	12
There are parts of SS that are entitlements, and not necessary to pay in to get.  Many illegal parents are getting it through public school system by insisting their kids have ADD.  I heard all about it from a teacher supervisor.	1037125083528146945	politifact677	10
Correct. Some have been given money from SS from non-contributors which should be fixed, but most of us contribute money to it.	3323787340	politifact677	12

I'm sure he will not want an interview for sometime. She had him and no where to go.	843003168	politifact677	8
Just watched Maria grill davidcicilline.  This was as good as it gets!!!  Maria had him tongue tied.  Maria needs a weekly show.  I could think of a time slot she could take, 3pm weekdays.	244475144	politifact677	10

"Yep! Maria takes 3 PM slot. Juan leaves the 5 seat and joins Sheppard on the new 1 AM to 3 AM ( they need 2 hours to clear their Democrat BS each day), new ""5"" seat person. I would be happy with that."	4895041395	politifact677	10
It is so upsetting to watch him lie. Thanks as well Maria for not caving to him trying to talk over you	989687849036533760	politifact677	0
Cicilline proves propaganda is as alive and well as it was 100 years ago during WWI. What a horror it was to lose the House. To stand so obtusely against objective facts is to reject reality. He knows the truth and deliberately rejects it, choosing the presence of injustice.	325361519	politifact677	7
David is the typical lying Democrat:	700178942	politifact677	3

"Great job Maria!! Dems raised my healthcare 5 fold.
Keep them honest. Lying Cicilline"	980103463	politifact677	13
My healthcare was ruined under Obamacare, as well.  Trump was already talking about ways to get drug prices down and that lying Dem was trying to act like it was their idea.	1037125083528146945	politifact677	10
Keep calling David Cicilline out on his BS. His party wants to decrease the cost of healthcare when in fact his parry was responsible for raising the cost via Obamacare.	752163186	politifact677	4
Dems also continuously like about what will happen to Medicare if they take it over, and about SS.  They have no shame about anything they do, no matter how low.	1037125083528146945	politifact677	0
"which desert sand has D Cicilline had his head stuck in...sees no FISA abuse, does not accept McCabe and other fired employees as ""offenders""...we can expect 2 years of nothing done in House of Rep...terrible way to serve the people of country..did voters actualy ""vote"" for this?"	808128162	politifact677	7

You do realize he wasn't giving a discount to christians, it was for a church bulletin. Anyone can walk in a church on a Sunday morning, grab a bulletin and walk out to go get their discount.

I studied a lot of things at NYU, but ultimately it came down to a storytelling major centered on games. I discovered a dream I never knew I had: work for Nintendo on the Legend of Zelda team. Of course, that was a bit far-fetched. But it's an idea that has never left me.	1063099689711607808	politifact13900	4
I never really followed that dream. I made do with fanart and a story that I began in 2008. To this day I pour so much time and energy into that story that I tried justifying it by making an original version. Change some names, a few plotlines so it's less of a mirror image.	1063099689711607808	politifact13900	4
"But I don't want an original version. I wanted a Zelda story that fans would read and think, ""Wow, she's serious."" Because I am. This means a lot to me.

That's the deal with Hideki Kamiya for example- I see tons of tweets directed at him for games and such, even ones he had no hand in, but never really engaging him. I think it's cool how accessible Twitter is, it makes interactions with creators all across the board easy.	86353148	politifact13900	4
It's no wonder the man is frustrated. And most folks don't get it. They're offended by the fact the creator doesn't want to talk about their work 24/7. Again, not a blanket statement- not everyone thinks differently. Things get lost in translation, too. But this much is universal	86353148	politifact13900	0
With anyone, well-known or not, that's a person behind the screen, not a content-creating robot. They're not always going to want to talk about video games, and Twitter is a space for all sorts of discussion. And, it's the same thing IRL or on any other platform.	86353148	politifact13900	12
If you have a question- wait for a Q&A if the person doesn't actively answering questions. Phrase it nicely! Check for signs of interest in communication. Also, be vigilant. Check to see if it's already been asked and answered. Be respectful, too.	86353148	politifact13900	2

Iizuka-san, like any other developer, works for a company. He is not the center of the series' faults. That's like blaming the CEO of a fast food chain for a few bad burgers you had  at a few of their stores. There is so much to a company.

This is exactly what I'm talking about. There is no respect for these developers. You ONLY see their work and judge them. What if I were to judge you purely for what you make? If you did a bad job on something, does that give me the right to call you names? No!	86353148	politifact13900	4

That's not true either. You watch him at panels, he enjoys the events they hold and he's always actively supporting the series. He's been trying to push for the series to change, and he MADE Mania happen. That was one of the most difficult things anyone could do.	86353148	politifact13900	7

It may not be so much xenophobia as it is filtering out views from 'illegal' streamers (clearing out cookies and tricking youtube algorithim).

Illegal wasnt the right word, but streaming is heavily discouraged by yt's system. There's a reason why people have to delete their cookies, history, and sign out of their yt accounts when they want to stream and give a video lots of view counts.	777337577879863296	politifact13900	10
