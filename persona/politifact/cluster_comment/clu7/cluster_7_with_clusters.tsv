"3.)Now let's do some math:
Roy Moore Needs 20,715 Votes:He received net 15,193 votes from Military

Moore lost to Democrat Doug Jones on Tuesday night by some 20,000 votes - 650,436 votes, or 48 percent, to 671,151, or 50 percent. Moore has refused to concede the race to Jones, saying he will wait until all provisional and military ballots are counted and the race is certified.	28834927	politifact14859	7

Giuliani's father was an enforcer for a loan-sharking operation, and he had cousins in the mafia, that and his own professional experience means that he should know better - but trump doesn't hire people who know better. He hires people who are corrupt.	25259962	politifact1731	7

Sorry Phil, but while this may demonstrate the independence of the judiciary, what you ignore is it also proves that a disgraceful politically motivated witch hunt occurred against Diane as it does anyone who puts their head above the parapet.

Sorry Dr Rushworth, but these are two separate issues. What this judgment has done is shown that the judiciary has been kept free of political influence. The judiciary played no part in the investigation and arrest and should correctly be discussed separately.	2814840854	politifact8085	3
The fact is, we don't know what pressure may or may not have been exerted behind the scenes, and we are unlikely to ever know, so discussing it in the same light as verifiable facts is poor form and a (negative) political statement in its own right. 2/3	2814840854	politifact8085	6
I understand what you are saying Sam, but it's unsubstantiated whataboutery.

"There was no whataboutery in my comment at all.

Kagame has bowed to pressure. That is what this shows.	4500962182	politifact8085	9

In order for this to 'prove' the judiciary is free of political influence you would first have to prove that by acquiting Diane it was acting against political pressure to do the opposite. Is Phil saying that the RPF was exerting pressure which the judiciary defied? 1/2	61862447	politifact8085	3

Yes, Bernie Sanders was one of only two Senators who voted against weakening the Iran deal.  The question is why Democrats would vote for such a thing.	310307962	politifact100	6
The vote was not a weakening of the Iran Deal. Sanders also voted against the Magnitsky Act proving that he has a dubious need to protect Russia. But thanks for admitting that Sanders is owned by Putin which is why the email transcripts between Tad Devine and him are important.	838595784207708160	politifact100	5
I admit no such thing.  Every Democrat in the Senate voted to make war on innocent civilians with sanctions that would not hurt Putin at all, and to weaken the Iran deal as well.  You should be ashamed of them.	310307962	politifact100	5

The assault weapons ban saved far more lives than the Brady bill between 1994 and 2004 while it was in effect, the number of gun deaths/shooting skyrocketed afterwards.
