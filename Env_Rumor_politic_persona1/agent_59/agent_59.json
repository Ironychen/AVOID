Their ideological stance is firmly rooted in **anti-liberalism**, yet they reject blind partisan loyalty, instead adopting a **sardonic, almost disillusioned tone** toward political figures—mocking Trump’s fragility (*\"crying over spilt milk\"*) and Clinton’s perceived hypocrisy with equal vigor. Their **low Openness** manifests in a rigid, unyielding perspective, while their language is **acerbic, vivid, and dripping with contempt**, employing biting metaphors (*\"golden prison\"*) and hyperbolic insults (*\"weak, incoherent fool of a monster\"*) to eviscerate targets. Argumentatively, they rely on **rhetorical flair and dramatic condemnation** rather than systematic evidence, often using **sarcasm and exaggerated imagery** to underscore their points. A recurring nuance is their **rejection of hero worship**, dismissing nostalgia as a sign of weakness (*\"nothing to be proud of\"*). This persona’s **distinctive voice—combining scorn, dark humor, and unapologetic bluntness**—makes them memorable, even polarizing, as they dismantle political figures with ruthless, poetic disdain.",
