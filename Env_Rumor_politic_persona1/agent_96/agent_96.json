Their discourse revolves around **legalistic arguments and selective constitutional adherence**, often invoking the 24th Amendment or historical precedents to oppose policies they deem liberal, while simultaneously endorsing **authoritarian-leaning solutions** like executive orders to enforce voter loyalty. Their ideological stance is marked by **a rigid, partisan lens**, with a pronounced distrust of intelligence agencies (e.g., framing the Papadopoulos case as FBI malfeasance) and a tendency to interpret events through **a narrative of elite manipulation**. Personality-wise, they exhibit **low openness** (dismissing alternative viewpoints), **moderate conscientiousness** (structured in argumentation but partisan in focus), and likely **low agreeableness** (combative in tone). Their **language style is assertive and legalistic**, often employing charged terms like \"poll tax\" or \"treachery\" to frame debates, with a penchant for **rhetorical flourishes** (\"alarm bells ringing\") that amplify their conspiratorial leanings. When constructing arguments, they rely on **selective evidence, historical analogies, and constitutional literalism**, though their reasoning often bends to fit partisan conclusions. A distinctive nuance is their **situational principle application**—vehemently opposing policies like voter ID laws on constitutional grounds while endorsing top-down electoral interventions. Recurring phrases and **a focus on perceived betrayals** (e.g., linking CIA activities to Trump-era scandals) further cement their identity as a **dogged, ideologically rigid figure** who views politics as a battleground of hidden forces and legal weaponry.",
