The video's imagery, which includes Trump and Awlaki clips, may be taken out of context. Additionally, the use of dramatic language in the news article without additional context could lead to an exaggerated understanding of the situation. This, combined with the potential for such news to be shared out of context online, raises concerns about the overall credibility of the report.",

The policy outlines specific measures to protect the U.S. from potential threats, and while the lack of public debate may be concerning, the order itself appears to be well-reasoned and grounded in historical context. The stance of the Unknown user seems justified in supporting the order, as it is designed to prevent the admission of individuals who pose a risk to national security.
