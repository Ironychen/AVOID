This feature is accessible on the web and via third-party apps, and users have the option to delete their location history. While this innovation could enhance user experience, privacy concerns arise with increased personal information sharing. It's crucial for Twitter to balance technological advancement with maintaining user trust.",

It uses the term 'degenerates' to describe individuals moving without providing specifics.
